### 🔑 Grafana SSO Authentication via GitHub
We’ve made logging into Grafana easier! Now, you can sign in using your GitHub account through Single Sign-On (SSO), 
so there's no need to manage another password. Simply click **Sign in with GitHub** on the Grafana login page, and you’re in!

**Why this is great:**
- No more remembering passwords
- Secure authentication via GitHub

## 🔧 Config Management

### 📦 Deployed in All Sites and Ready for Production
Our **Config Management** system has been successfully deployed across all environments and is now ready for production use!

---

## 🛠️ CI/CD Improvements

### 📝 Helm Lint in the PR Workflow
To ensure higher quality and smoother deployments, we’ve added **Helm linting** as part of the pull request workflow.  
This will help us catch issues with Helm charts early on, preventing errors during deployment.

## 📦 Upgrading The Entire MC-Packages

We took a major step forward by upgrading our entire MapColonies packages.  
It’s now fully compatible with the latest versions, ensuring improved performance and stability.

### 🚨 Upgrades with BREAKING CHANGES:

#### ESLint Upgrade: v8 -> v9

Key changes in ESLint 9:

* Flat Config as the default: Simplifies configuration with `eslint.config.js` as the single format.  
  Better default settings: Supports newer JavaScript syntax by default, like ECMAScript latest version and ESM.

* Improved plugin and rule management: Makes it easier to set up and use ESLint with various plugins and rule sets.

* Performance improvements: Faster linting, especially in large projects.

These updates make ESLint 9 a more streamlined tool, improving both ease of setup and performance.

#### Open Telemetry Upgrades 
* We’ve updated the telemetry package to the latest versions of all OpenTelemetry dependencies. 
This will help improve the observability and reliability of our services.  
You can see the PR [here](https://github.com/MapColonies/telemetry/pull/125)

## 🛡️ Authentication

### 🔐 New Informative Properties in OPA Response
We’ve added to the response clients get from OPA some new properties. One important property is the **"sub"** field, 
which represents the client name. This can be very helpful when monitoring requests and analyzing usage by clients. 

### 🔒 Masking Tokens for Security
We’ve masked the token information in OPA responses.  
This adds an additional layer of security and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data.

## 📑 New Helm Library for Labels and Annotations

We’ve created a new Helm library named [labels and annotations](https://github.com/MapColonies/labels-and-annotations). 
This library is responsible for adding common labels and annotations to any service that uses it as a dependency. 

**Why this is helpful:**
- **Consistency**: All services in the project will have the required labels and annotations
- **Improve Visualization**: These labels will be used to help centralize services from all teams in one dashboard
