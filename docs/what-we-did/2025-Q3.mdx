## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### 🪵 Welcome [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest): Our New Logging Solution
We're excited to complete our observability! Alongside **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)** for metrics and **[Tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest)** 
for traces, we've now integrated **Loki** as our official logging solution.

Loki will aggregate logs from all our services, providing a centralized place to search, analyze, and debug.  
Logs will be processed in OpenTelemetry format via [Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest).

To get started, you can enable log scraping for your service by simply adding the following label to your pods: `mapcolonies.io/alloy-api-logs`.  
After that, you can see the logs immediately [here](https://grafana.mapcolonies.net/a/grafana-lokiexplore-app/explore)

:::info
In the future, we will release a dedicated NPM logger package, so in the meantime, DO NOT set this label on your NodeJS services.

## 🛡️ Authentication

### 🔑 Token Kiosk for Temporary Access
We've launched the **Token Kiosk**, a new service for issuing temporary tokens to B2C clients. 
This is especially useful for applications like ArcGIS-Pro and ArcMap, where preventing token sharing across different machines is a security priority.

**Key Features:**
* **Secure Access**: The service generates temporary tokens and can distinguish between different devices to ensure tokens aren't shared.
* **SSO Integration**: It uses an SSO to authenticate users securely.
* **User-Friendly UI**: A simple, Hebrew-language interface allows users to generate a token, view an expiration countdown, and copy the token with a single click.
* **Token Lifecycle**: Tokens are valid for one week by default, and all issuance is logged in a database for tracking.

Feel free to tell your friends and show them the kiosk [here](https://kiosk.mapcolonies.net)😉

## 💸 Infrastructure & Cost Optimization

### 📉 Weekend Auto-Scaler
To help reduce costs, we've implemented a new **auto-scaling tool**. This tool automatically downscales all non-prod deployments over the weekend.  
Don't worry, the tool scales them back up to their original replica counts first thing on Sunday morning.  

Whenever the tool starts working, it reports everything to our slack channel *infra-notifications* so if anything goes wrong, we'll be the first one to know and fix it.

This simple change allows us to optimize our resource usage and save money without impacting performance during the work week.

## 🚀 CI/CD Improvements

### 🕵️ Jenkins Observability
Ever had a pipeline fail without a clear reason?  
We've enhanced our Jenkins setup with improved observability.  
This will make it significantly easier to debug pipeline issues, detect errors proactively, and understand performance bottlenecks, 
leading to a more stable and reliable CI/CD environment.

## 🗃️ Databases

### 🔒 Postgres with SSL for Local Development
We've published a [new repository](https://github.com/MapColonies/postgres-ssl) containing instructions on how to easily deploy **Postgres with SSL**.  
This allows developers to test their services in an environment that more closely mirrors production, 
ensuring that database connections are secure and properly configured before deployment.

What are you waiting for?😱 Go deploy your secured postgres!!

## 🚦 Service Health & Status

### ✨ New Status Page Initiative
We've begun work on a centralized **Status Page** for the entire MapColonies project. This page will be the single source of truth for questions like:
* What's the operational status of each team's services?
* What alerts are currently active?
* What is the uptime for key applications?

The status will be presented as a **Grafana dashboard**, built on metrics enriched with [MapColonies labels and annotations](https://github.com/MapColonies/labels-and-annotations) according to project requirements.

This is a collaborative effort, and soon we will be working closely with all teams to build out their respective sections on the page.
