# Default config

Step by step guide on how to create a [default config](../../knowledge-base/config-management/default-configs.md) for your schema to ease the deployment of your service.

### Assumptions

This guide assumes that you have an understanding of creating schemas and already created a schema for your service.
Check out the [Zero to Hero](./zero-to-hero.mdx) guide if you haven't created a schema yet.

The examples in this guide will use the schema `my-schema` with version `v1` that was created in the `Zero to Hero` guide.


## create your default config
1. Create a file named `v1.configs.json` in the same folder as your schema file.
```json title="schemas/my-domain/my-schema/v1.configs.json"
[]
```

2. Choose a name for your default config:
```json title="schemas/my-domain/my-schema/v1.configs.json"
[
  {
    "name": "default-config",
    "value": {}
  }
]
```

3. Add the default config value based on the schema:
```json title="schemas/my-domain/my-schema/v1.configs.json"
[
  {
    "name": "default-config",
    "value": {
      "id": "default-id",
      "name": "default-name",
      "age": 18
      "isAlive": true
    }
  }
]
```

## Run validations
Run the validation script to make sure the default config is valid.
```bash
npm run validate
```

## Add a reference to another default config
If your default config has a [reference](../../knowledge-base/config-management/references.mdx) to another config you created, or a common config you can reference it in the value:
```json title="schemas/my-domain/my-schema/v1.configs.json"
[
  {
    "name": "default-config",
    "value": {
      "commonConfig": {
        "$ref": {
          "configName": "other-config",
          "version": "latest"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Next steps
Now that you finished writing your default config, you can submit a PR to the schemas repo and ask for it to be reviewed.
