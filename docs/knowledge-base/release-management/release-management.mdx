# Release Management Guide

This document outlines the release management process for Libot Mipuy, which involves multiple teams and services. 
The release strategy follows semantic versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) for individual services and the "Libot version" which is used for managing our deployment stack in different networks.

## Libot Version Tag

The **Libot Version** is an alias to a specific `helm-charts` release version. 
This means that it represents the entirety of all service releases for the production deployment and it's structure.  

## Service Branching Strategy

Each service must maintain at least one main branch to track the latest stable release and major version updates:

1. **`master`**:
   - Represents the latest stable version of the service.
   - Merges to this branch indicate the most recent production-ready release.
   
2. **`MAJOR.x.x`** (e.g., `1.x.x`, `2.x.x`):
   - Tracks the major version series of a service.
   - A new branch is created for every major version that is smaller than the latest major version.
   - Example:
     - If a service's latest release version is `3.3.0` and a new bug fix needs to be merged to latest release with major version '2', 
       a pull request (PR) will be created for both:
       - `master` (represents 3.x.x) - only if the bug fix relevant to this release too
       - `2.x.x` (to track the new version with the fix).
     - Once merged, both branches will represent a release with the bug fix, while the `1.x.x` branch remains unchanged.

## Service Release Flow

![Releasing Flow](./images/release-on-repo.png)

Explanation:

1. The developer creates a PR

2. On merging to master `release-please` takes action and opens a release PR with these changes:
    - Updating all relevant files with the new release version
    - Updating Changelog with the new version details
    - Updating helm (chart version)

    :::info
    The release version will be based on [SemVer](https://semver.org/) 
    (according to the PR title that will be based on [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint))
    :::

3. On merging the release PR to master, `release-please` will create a new release

4. On new release, some automate workflows will be triggered:
    - Push to `NPM` (for libraries)
    - Build a docker image and push to registry (if a `Dockerfile` exists)
    - Pack the helm chart and push to registry (if a `helm` chart exists)

**End State:**
    - New release version based on `SemVer`
    - master points to the new release
    - New release is pushed to `npm`, `docker` and `helm` registries

:::info
The deployment part is described in the next section

## Helming Strategy

:::warning
This strategy does not include the checks you should make during the development process such a running tests. 
All of the development tests should occur before release.
We assume that the new released service is properly checked and its updated chart is properly constructed.
:::

![Helming Strategy](./images/helm-strategy.png)

The project includes two different repositories that represent two different flows:

1. **Chart Flow using "Helm-Charts" repo** - Handling the new charts and versions from the services and creates a new release version 

2. **Values Flow using "Helm-Values" repo** - Handling the deployment in openshift based on the new `helm-chart` version that was created in `helm-charts`

### Explanation

The main goal is to separate the development part of `helm charts` (the structure) from the deployment part (the `values`).

`helm-charts` repo will contain only the chart, which is the deployment structure, and a default `values` file. 
The structure shouldn't change much from now on (for the current set of features).  
`helm-values` repo will contain **only the values based on the relevant chart** 
and the `helm-chart` version it's based on (a file named "helm-charts.json" in the repo).
The value files that represent openshift namespaces should not be part of the structure 
(as they are only config files), they should be in a different repo.
This gives us the following benefits:

1. **Avoiding "irrelevant" commits**  
Imagine if we keep the values with the chart. If we want to change the log level, for example, from `info` to `debug`, 
we will have to commit the change as part of the chart. This is true for all changes made to any value. 
This means we will clutter the repo with a lot of commits that don't have anything to do with the core of the chart itself.

2. **Informative versions for helm-charts**  
If we keep the chart and the values together, we will have a hard time properly handling the release of helm-chart due to 
the many changes on the values (which aren't part of a release).
On the other hand, there are some value changes that are more meaningful that we want to document.
For example, you want to change the default port to be 80. This is a "structure" change because you want to set a new default value.
If you keep the values as part of the chart, you won't know what requires a new release and what doesn't.
When they are separated, it is clearer what changes are a core part of your chart.

3. **One true structure**
Currently, the charts in the network are different from the charts in Azure because they can be modified. 
Using the new strategy, we make sure that there will be one source of truth which is `helm-charts`.

4. **Simpler deployment**  
Keeping the values with the core structure forces us to manage every chart (along with the values) in different branches, 
which makes it harder to manage.
With the new strategy, we need to only "worry" about the values and the version of the chart before moving on to the deployment.
We can run this command template:  
`helm install myrelease oci://HELM_REGISTRY/helm-charts/raster-ingestion --version VERSION`  
And that's it! We don't need the chart in the repo anymore. We make the structure and the config independent of each other.

Let's walk through the flows!

### Chart Flow

![Chart Flow](./images/chart-flow.png)

This flow handles the update of `helm-charts` and the creation of a new release version.

1. When a service has a new release and helm folder (points that its chart in helm-charts needs to be updated), 
open a PR in helm-charts that update the version of the service.

:::note
The developer should see the PR and make more changes if necessary
:::

2. After the PR is ready, merge the PR.

::::info
The PR accumulates changes made from multiple repositories, updating the versions of services in the chart as you release them. 
Notice that it isn't necessary to merge every change, this way you can accumulate changes until you have your stable team (or multiple teams) version.

:::tip
If there is a service that you don't want to include it yet in helm-charts, you can disable the workflow that triggers that PR
:::

::::

3. On "master" push:
    - Create a new release using release-please. 
    The release-please should also update the docker and helm versions of the services in:
        - `artifacts.json` file inside the domain that represent the information of all services and versions of the domain
        - `libot-artifacts.json` in the root directory that represent the information of all services and versions of **all** domains

    - Package all the charts and push them to helm registry.  
    For example:  
    On new `helm-chart` release with version 3.0.1, we will push to helm registry the raster-ingestion chart with this name: `rater-ingestion-3.0.1`. 

**End State**:

* New "Helm-Chart Version" 
* Charts of the new version packed in helm registry.

Now, we have an updated structure of the chart and we can move on to the values.

### Values Flow

![Values Flow](./images/values-flow.png)

This flow suppose to handle the update of the namespaces values (integration and prod) and the deployment in openshift.

0. On new release, there will be a PR on stage branch in `helm-values` repo that updates the "Helm-Chart Version" in `helm-charts.json` file

1. There will be an auto deploy in "integration" namespace

2. After running and testing the new chart (locally and remotely) and making sure the structure and values work as intended, you may merge the PR

3. Once the stage branch is updated, a new PR will be automatically created in "prod" branch to update the "Helm-Chart Version" in the file

After the PR to the prod branch is created, it is the developer responsibility to deploy and merge the PR.

**End State**:

* Updated values in all branches based on "Helm-Chart Version"
* Updated `helm-charts.json` file in every branch
* Updated deployments in all namespaces in openshift

:::info
The values flow is the same flow in the network. 
There will be helm-values repo based on branches (each branch will represent a namespace in openshift) 
and in every branch there will be a file named: `helm-charts.json` that will represent the related chart version
:::

## Libot Version Strategy

![Libot Version Strategy](./images/libot-version-strategy.png)

This flow handles the release of "[Libot Version](#libot-version-tag)".

1. Trigger through Jenkins the creation of new Libot Release Version. 
The pipeline will allow you to choose from one of helm-chart releases the release you want to sign as new "Libot Version"

2. Jenkins will document in confluence the difference between the latest Libot Version and the new one that was just created.
The document should include also the changelog of the actual services rather than just the versions diff.

3. At the end, the pipeline will trigger the bundler pipeline 

## Bundle Strategy

![Bundling Strategy](./images/bundler-strategy.png)

You can see more about bundler and unbundler [here](../DevOps/pipelines/bundler-unbundler.mdx).  
The only change is that the bundler pipeline will be able to create a bundle based on the "Libot Version".
