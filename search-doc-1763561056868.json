Make sure to set the boilerplate as the template repository.Clone the new repository to your local machine. git clone https://github.com/MapColonies/my-new-amazing-repo.git or if you prefer using ssh: git clone git@github.com:MapColonies/my-new-amazing-repo.git Set the name of the project in the package.json and package-lock.json files. Change the name field to match your project's name. { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;my-new-amazing-repo&quot;, ... } Edit the README.md file to match your project's name and description. You can also add any additional information that is relevant to your project. Rename any mention of ts-server-boilerplate in the codebase to match your project's name. You should use VS Code or any other IDE to search for the term ts-server-boilerplate and replace it with your project's name. Rename the src/resourceName and src/anotherResource directories and change the content of the files inside them to match your project's resources. You can also add any additional resources that are relevant to your project. Edit the liveness probe in the src/index.ts file to match your project's needs. The liveness probe is responsible for checking the health of the application and returning a response to the client. The liveness probe is configured to return a 200 OK response if the application is healthy, otherwise the application is unhealthy.

You can also add any additional tests that are relevant to your project. Run your tests to make sure everything is working as expected. npm run test From here on, you can start developing your project using the boilerplate as a starting point.

When provider equals &quot;s3&quot;, the validator knows to use the first schema (where credentials is a string defaulting to &quot;someExampleValue&quot;). When provider equals &quot;fs&quot;, it uses the second schema (where credentials is a number defaulting to 100).  Without a discriminator, the validator would need to try each schema sequentially, which is less efficient and produces less specific error messages. The discriminator pattern also enables type-safe handling of different object variants in strongly-typed languages.  note Note that while the default keyword specifies default values for each variant, not all JSON Schema validators or tools automatically apply these defaults. Some may treat them as annotations only. Check your validation library's documentation for how defaults are handled.  For more documentation on discriminators, see the Ajv JSON Schema documentation.
